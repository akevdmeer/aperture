Welcome to this tutorial, which delves into a selection of strategies designed to boost the resilience and adaptability of service infrastructure. In the challenging field of service provision, it's recognized that achieving 100% service availability at all times is a lofty goal. Interruptions can be caused by a range of factors such as unpredictable client behaviors, sudden surges in demand, or service outages due to software bugs.

There are scenarios where traditional methods, like distributed circuit breaking, may not be adequate despite being generally effective in controlling throughput. For example, a situation could arise when a large number of hosts are forwarding traffic to a few servers, potentially overwhelming the target hosts. Balancing these traffic patterns to prevent cascading failure can be a challenging task. In these cases, global rate limiting serves as a practical solution.

This tutorial highlights several strategies, one of which involves the use of a quota scheduler. This method is especially valuable when the goal is to efficiently manage rising infrastructure utilization. In high-demand scenarios, quota schedulers can be configured to assign static quotas to service partner calls. When quotas are reached, the scheduler's configuration, based on inbound request details, directs and prioritizes additional calls, ensuring efficient handling of critical requests.
